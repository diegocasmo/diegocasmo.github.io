Fortunately, I found\nthe\n<a href=\"https://github.com/priya-dwivedi/Deep-Learning/tree/master/handwriting_recognition\">“handwriting_recognition”</a>\nJupyter notebook by <a href=\"https://github.com/priya-dwivedi\">“Priyanka Dwivedi”</a>,\nwhich uses the method explained in the paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06472\">“DeepWriter: A\nMulti-Stream Deep CNN for Text-independent Writer\nIdentification”</a> to solve this\nproblem.</p>\n<p>I had some issues while trying to understand the notebook, as it\nlacks specific instructions on how to setup the dataset and how\nexactly the data parsing is done. As a result, I decided to rewrite\nthe notebook step-by-step to improve my own understanding of the\nmethod, and hopefully help others who wish to do the same.</p>\n<p>The code and instructions on how to set it up can be found in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/diegocasmo/iam_writer_recognition\">“iam_writer_recognition”</a>\nrepository. I have tried to explain each step during the process\nas clearly as possible, as well as to provide visual examples of\nwhat the code is doing at each step. Let me know if you have any\nquestions or suggestions on how to improve it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"IAM Dataset Writer Recognition Using a CNN","date":"November 09, 2018","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-10-24-convolutional-neural-networks-for-galaxy-morphology-classification/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Convolutional Neural Networks For Galaxy Morphology Classification"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019-08-19-okrs-as-a-framework-for-personal-growth/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"OKRs as a Framework for Personal Growth"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9a524dd3-4f74-5db0-b527-8f958edb08ce","previousPostId":"41390dd6-a0ef-50df-b1be-50e8737fa6a4","nextPostId":"154fba6c-3001-5d9e-b549-c1abdb2bc45d"}},
