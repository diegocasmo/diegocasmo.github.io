Is\nit possible to use OKRs for personal growth?” Sure, you could argue\nkeeping track of money is certainly easier than keeping track of\nhappiness/health, but a quick search for <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=okrs+for+personal+growth&#x26;ia=web\">OKRs for personal\ngrowth</a> allowed\nme to realize I wasn’t alone in this camp. I have now being using\nOKRs as a framework for personal growth for three years, and it is\nby far the most important tool I use to align my goals with my\nday-to-day actions.</p>\n<p>In this short blog post, I’ll share my experience\nwith OKRs during the past three years. I hope it can help you to\nlearn from my mistakes and consider systematically tracking progress\ntowards your goals if not already doing it.</p>\n<p>Initially, I used OKRs as a framework to hold myself accountable\nfor professional continuous learning. I work as a software developer,\nand as such, I like to keep myself up-to-date with new trends/technologies\nas well as study well established software concepts. As I gained\nmore confidence and got used to <strong>measuring my actions</strong>, I started\nto create objectives and key results related to health, music,\nreading, and other areas of life I wanted to become better at. Only\nonce I started to measure my progress towards these goals I was\nable to realize that I wasn’t doing what I actually wanted to do\n(pretty dumb, right?). How was I supposed to become a better jazz\nguitar player if I didn’t put enough hours of practice? How was I\ngoing to ever increase my squat if I wasn’t actually training? This\nwas a weird but important realization for me. OKRs gave me the\n<strong>visibility</strong> I needed to better understand my actions and evaluate\nhow these were related to my goals.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long to learn motivation is overrated. While effective\nwhen present, consistency and discipline are far more powerful\ntools. OKRs taught me that a <strong>structured path and consistency</strong>\nwere the most important tools to achieve success. This is basically\nwhat schools and other institutions do for us. We delegate to these\ninstitutions the creation and evaluation of a curriculum that will\nallows us to gain the required knowledge to become a professional\nin some area. Only issue though, is that once we are done with these\ninstitutions, it is up to us to create a “curriculum” and evaluate\nwhether we are making progress towards our personal and professional\ngoals.</p>\n<p>Using OKRs as a framework to track my personal growth eventually\nled me to realize I wanted to do too many things. I was simply\nunable to fit in my schedule the tasks that needed to be done in\norder to make progress towards the goals I had set for myself. This\nled me to learn more about another important topic: <strong>prioritization</strong>.\nI had to prioritize and carefully choose what goals were of utmost\nimportance to me and only then execute. Interestingly enough, this\nexercise made me realize I had many goals which I actually didn’t\ncare that much about, and thus required less/no attention.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite things about OKRs is that these enforce creating\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria\">SMART</a> goals. As I\nsaid in the introduction, it is difficult to measure goals such as\nhow happy/healthy we are, but we can measure actions that make us\nhappier/healthier. In my case, these actions go anywhere from\ntraveling, training, writing or simply reading a book in my leisure\ntime. The best part is that consistently doing these actions leads\nto create <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Habit\">habits that have compounding\neffect</a> in my\nlife and those around me. Using OKRs has helped me to create and\nsustain habits that aid me to consistently grow as a person and\nprofessional.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Measuring how my day-to-day actions relate to my personal goals has\nbeen a complete game changer. OKRs is the one framework that has\nallowed me to do so consistently for the past three years.</p>\n<p>How do you hold yourself accountable for your personal growth?
