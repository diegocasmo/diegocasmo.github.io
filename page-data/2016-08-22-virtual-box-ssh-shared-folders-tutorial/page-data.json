Since I became a full time independent software developer, I have frequently found myself working on very different software environments. VirtualBox has helped me to setup an environment for each of my clients and easily manage them.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to setup a virtual machine instance with shared folders and SSH from your host to the guest. This tutorial assumes you have already setup an Ubuntu server virtual machine.</p>\n<h3>SSH from Host into Guest Machine Setup:</h3>\n<p>SSH is a protocol used to securely log onto remote systems. It is the most frequent way to access remote Unix-like servers.</p>\n<h4>Instructions:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Start the VM</li>\n<li>Go to <code class=\"language-text\">Settings > Network > Advanced > Port Forwarding</code></li>\n<li>Click in the <code class=\"language-text\">Add new port forwarding rule</code> green button in the top right of the window</li>\n<li>Rule example setup:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">| Name | Protocol | Host IP | Host Port | Guest IP | Guest Port |\n|------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|------------|\n|  SSH |    TCP   |         |    2281   |          |     22     |</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Click <code class=\"language-text\">Ok</code> to add rule</li>\n<li>Install SSH server on guest</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>And that’s it! Now type <code class=\"language-text\">ssh username@localhost -p 2281</code> to SSH from your host machine to the guest</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Shared Folders Setup:</h3>\n<p>Shared folders provide an easy way to exchange files between the host and the guest machine. This means you can access and modify your local files with your favorite tools and still run the server and its dependencies on your virtual machine.</p>\n<h4>Instructions:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Install VirtualBox Guest Additions:\n<ul>\n<li>Locate the VirtualBox Guest Additions at <code class=\"language-text\">/Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</code></li>\n<li>Copy it to a location that is accessible when browsing for files</li>\n<li>Start the VM</li>\n<li>Click the CD icon in the bottom right task bar</li>\n<li>Select <code class=\"language-text\">Choose disk image...</code> and search for the <code class=\"language-text\">VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</code></li>\n<li>In the guest terminal type (you can also do this from the host terminal if you SSH into it):</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">  sudo su\n  apt update\n  apt upgrade\n  apt-get install dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic gcc make\n  mount /dev/cdrom /mnt\n  cd /mnt\n  sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n  reboot</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting up the shared folder:\n<ul>\n<li>Go to <code class=\"language-text\">Settings > Shared Folders</code></li>\n<li>Click in the <code class=\"language-text\">Add new port forwarding rule</code>   green button in the top right of the window:\n<ul>\n<li>Search and select the folder you would like to share</li>\n<li>Select the <code class=\"language-text\">Auto-mount</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Make Permanent</code> options</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Start the VM</li>\n<li>Add user to the <code class=\"language-text\">vboxsf</code> group by running <code class=\"language-text\">sudo adduser username vboxsf</code> and reboot the VM</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">cd</code> into the <code class=\"language-text\">/etc</code> directory and open the file <code class=\"language-text\">rc.local</code> with sudoer access</li>\n<li>Type the following command right above <code class=\"language-text\">exit 0</code>:</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># 'folder_name' = given in the shared folders configuration\n# 'path/to/shared/folders' = guest path to access the shared folders from\nsudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared_folder_name path/to/shared/folders</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>And that’s it! You should now be able to see your shared folders at <code class=\"language-text\">path/to/shared/folders</code> in the guest</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I hope you found this tutorial easy to follow and useful. I have also been reading a lot about Vagrant, as it seems to be another popular choice by developers. I plan on giving it a try in the following months, and will let you know my opinion about it.
