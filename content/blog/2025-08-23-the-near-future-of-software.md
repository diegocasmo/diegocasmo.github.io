User expectations shifted at scale, almost overnight. LLMs taught people that they can state intent in plain language and watch software act. There is no going back.

You see it everywhere. Instead of picking an Instagram filter, people want to say how they want the photo to look. Instead of keyword hunting on Pinterest, they want to describe the room they imagine and get options that feel right. On Amazon, they may not know the product name, but they can describe the job to be done and expect to find it. People have felt “I tell the app, it does the thing.” That is the bar now.

Most software was built before this shift. It reflects the old paradigm: learn the interface, click the right buttons, get what you need. That still works, and it will not disappear. It becomes the foundation the new paradigm builds on. Let users express intent first, then expose the traditional controls to refine, verify, and repeat.

If that is the direction, the next question is where to apply it. Not every surface should move to intent-first. Slapping a text box on top of a product is easy and usually underwhelming. The valuable work is deeper. Ground the model in real data. Wire tools that perform real actions. Add memory where it reduces friction. Put evaluation in place so quality does not drift as the surface area grows.

None of this removes craft. It raises the bar. Data modeling still matters. Permissions and safety still matter. Good defaults still matter. The difference is that the UX centers on what a person wants, not on how your system is organized internally. If your product makes the user learn your schema, you are behind.

It is a great time to be a builder. New products can launch AI-first. Existing products can lift the ceiling on what users can do without burying them in UI. I feel this shift every day as I use software. Intelligent, helpful, and action-oriented is no longer a novelty. It is the baseline.

Users now expect intelligent apps. Meet them there.
