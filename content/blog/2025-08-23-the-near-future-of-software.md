title: The Near Future of Software

User expectations shifted almost overnight. LLMs taught people that they can state intent in plain language and watch software act. There is no going back.

You see it everywhere. Instead of picking an Instagram filter, people want to say how they want the photo to look. Instead of keyword hunting on Pinterest, they want to describe the room they imagine and get options that feel right. On Amazon, they may not know the product name, but they can describe the job to be done and expect to find it. People have experienced the feeling: “I tell the app, it does the thing.” That is the bar now.

## The Foundation and How It Fits

Most software was built before this shift. It reflects the old paradigm: learn the interface, click the right buttons, get what you need. That still works, and it will not disappear. It becomes the foundation the new paradigm builds on. Let users express intent first, then expose the traditional controls to refine, verify, and repeat.

If that is the direction, the interesting question is where it actually fits. Not every surface needs intent-first. A text box on top of a product is easy and often underwhelming. What seems to matter is the boring stuff underneath: models grounded in real data, tools that do real work, a bit of memory where it reduces friction, and steady evaluation so quality does not drift as things grow. Put differently, the magic feels real when the foundation is real.

## Craft and Opportunity

Which brings me to craft. None of this replaces it. It simply raises the bar. Data modeling still matters. Permissions and safety still matter. Good defaults still matter. The difference is that the UX orbits what a person wants, not how the system is organized. When a product makes me learn its schema first, it feels dated.

It is a great time to be a builder. New products can launch AI-first. Existing products can lift the ceiling on what users can do without burying them in UI. I feel this shift every day as I use software. Intelligent, helpful, and action-oriented is no longer a novelty. It is the baseline.

Users now expect intelligent apps. Meet them there.
