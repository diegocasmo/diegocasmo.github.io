title: Intent-First Software

User expectations shifted almost overnight. LLMs taught people they can state intent in plain language and watch software act.

Once I tried it, I wanted it (almost) everywhere. Instead of picking an Instagram filter, I want to say how I want the photo to look. Instead of keyword hunting on Pinterest, I want to describe the room I imagine and get options that feel right. On Amazon, I may not know the product name, but I can describe the job to be done and expect to find it. I have felt the shift: "I tell the app, it does the thing." That is the bar now.

## Foundation and fit

The direction is simple: intent first, interface second. Most software predates this shift and stays the base the new pattern builds on. In practice, intent starts the flow. The usual controls sit nearby to refine, verify, and repeat. A text box on top is easy and often underwhelming.

The change is the entry point. I no longer speak the product's map. I state the outcome. The product handles the map. Menus and forms stay, but they follow. Same system, different sequence.

It works because quality is finally good enough. Models act on product data well enough that intent does not feel like a demo. It shines when people can describe the goal better than they can navigate to it. It helps less when the task is already crisp, regulated, or step bound.

## Craft and opportunity

This does not replace craft. It raises expectations. Data modeling, permissions, safety, latency, and observability still decide whether intent can land. When a product makes me learn its schema first, it feels dated. Intent has edges. Audited flows, exactness, cost, and hallucinations still need rails and review. Put them in the path on purpose, not as a maze.

It is a great time to build. New products can launch intent first. Existing products can expand what people can do without burying them in UI. I feel this shift every day. Intelligent, helpful, action oriented software is no longer a novelty. It is the baseline. Build like users already expect it.
