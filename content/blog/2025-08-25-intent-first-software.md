LLMs taught people they can state intent in plain language and watch software act. Expectations shifted quickly.

Once I tried this, I wanted it in many places. It is not new, but it works better than before and is starting to stick. Instead of picking an Instagram filter, I say how I want the photo to look. Instead of keyword hunting on Pinterest, I describe the room I imagine and get options that feel right. On Amazon, I may not know the product name, but I can describe the job to be done and expect to find it. I tell the app, it does the thing. That increasingly feels like the bar, and it nudges how products should begin.

## Foundation and Fit

Quality is improving, and in more cases intent no longer feels like a demo. It often shines when people can describe the goal better than they can navigate to it. It helps less when compliance requires fixed, audited steps. Crisp tasks can benefit too when the tooling is solid.

The direction is simple: intent first, interface second. Most software predates this shift, so the old model remains the base the new pattern builds on. In practice, intent starts the flow; the usual controls sit nearby to refine, verify, and repeat.

I no longer speak the product's map. I state the outcome, and the product handles the map. Menus and forms still matter, but they follow. Same system, different sequence. If a product makes me learn its UI first, it often feels dated.

## Craft and Opportunity

This does not replace craft. It raises expectations. Data modeling, permissions, security, safety, latency, and observability still decide whether intent can land. Intent has edges. Prompt injection, audited flows, non-deterministic outputs, cost, and hallucinations still need rails and review.

All this to say: it is a good time to build. New products can launch intent first. Existing ones can expand what people can do without burying them in UI. I feel this shift every day. Intelligent, helpful, action-oriented software is becoming common. It is on its way to being a baseline expectation. Build like users already expect it.
