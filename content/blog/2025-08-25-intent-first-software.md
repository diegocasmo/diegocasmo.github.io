title: Intent-First Software

User expectations shifted almost overnight. LLMs taught people they can state intent in plain language and watch software act.

Once I tried it, I wanted it everywhere. Instead of picking an Instagram filter, I say how I want the photo to look. Instead of keyword hunting on Pinterest, I describe the room I imagine and get options that feel right. On Amazon, I may not know the product name, but I can describe the job to be done and expect to find it. I tell the app, it does the thing. That is the bar now, and it changes how products should begin.

## Foundation and fit

Quality finally crossed the line. Models can act on product data well enough that intent no longer feels like a demo. It shines when people can describe the goal better than they can navigate to it; it helps less when the task is already crisp, regulated, or step-bound.

The direction is simple: intent first, interface second. Most software predates this shift, so the old model is still the base the new pattern builds on. In practice, intent starts the flow; the usual controls sit nearby to refine, verify, and repeat.

I no longer speak the product's map. I state the outcome, and the product handles the map. Menus and forms still matter, but they follow. Same system, different sequence. If a product makes me learn its user interface first, it feels dated.

## Craft and opportunity

This does not replace craft. It raises expectations. Data modeling, permissions, safety, latency, and observability still decide whether intent can land. Intent has edges. Audited flows, exactness, cost, and hallucinations still need rails and review.

It is a great time to build. New products can launch intent first. Existing products can expand what people can do without burying them in UI. I feel this shift every day. Intelligent, helpful, action-oriented software is no longer a novelty. It is the baseline. Build like users already expect it.
